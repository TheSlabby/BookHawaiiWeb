## Inspiration for BookHawaii.
Tropical Theme, and a great idea to integrate many different tools and resources to demonstrate proficiency.

## What our Website does
**BookHawaii.** provides visitors with information about Hawaii, including popular destinations, the weather, and an estimated cost of airfare and hotel stay.

## How we built our website
- GitHub Projects to organize our development process
- GitHub repository to store our software and send it to our webserver using "git clone" over ssh
- Django for back-end development and Django templates to design the front-end.
- Digital Ocean to host the server
- Domain.com for the domain "bookhawaii.tech"
- MongoDB Atlas for a database consisting of Cities and weather data
- Free Trial of Weatherapi.com for real-time weather data
- Flyscanner API for real-time flight costs
- Python for calculation scripts
- MDBootstrap for HTML website templates that we edited to our use
- Repl.it for real-time HTML and python collaboration and development
- Wikipedia for information about Hawaii

## Challenges we ran into while developing our Website
- We struggled to find an adequate API for flight information
- We began this project with little experience using HTML
- We struggled to parse the correct forecast from WeatherAPI

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Despite our lack of HTML experience, our website looks very clean and user-friendly.
- Implementation of multiple APIs.

## What we learned
- We learned how to use MongoDB Atlas versus MongoDB locally on the host-server.
- We learned how to implement APIs and scripts into a website.
